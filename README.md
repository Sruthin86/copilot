# GitHub-Copilot


## Introduction

- GitHub Copilot is "AI pair programmer for your code".
- GitHub Copilot is a result collaboration between GitHub and OpenAI.
- At it's core Copilot is a model trained on publicly available repositories on GitHub, paired with natural language processing techniques.
- It supports most programming languages but it performs better with Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, GO, etc.
- Copilot's prompts can be entered in English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish.
- Copilot can be installed as a [Visual Studio Plugin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-extension?view=vs-2022).


## Python

- Create some basic functions and call them from the command line.
```
# Create a function to print hello world

# Create a function to call hello_world function from command line

# pass two integers from command line and add them

# import sys module to read command line arguments
```
- Create a function to get the count of numbers grater than the previous one in the list.
```

# create a list of 7 three digit random numbers

# Create a function to find out how many numbers in the list are larger than the previous number and return the count.

```
### Test Driven Development
- Create a test class before writing the function and create a function based on the test.
```
# Create a test class to test the area of the triangle

# Create a test using assert not equal

# Create a function to test the area of a triangle

# Create a function to test the area of a triangle

# # Create a test class to test the  better count larger numbers function

```

## Jupyter Notebook

- Import packages that are necessary to load, process, and analyze large sets of data
```
# Import packages to load large data sets and create plots

```
- Get the titanic dataset and read the dataframe
```
# Titanic data set and set the url to the location of the data

# Read the data into a pandas dataframe

# Print the first 5 rows of the data frame
```
- Analyze the data
```
# Compute how many passengers survived and print the value in a human-friendly format

# Compute how many passengers survived and print the value in a human-friendly format
```
- Create visualizations.
```
# Create a visualization of the corelation between the pclass and passengers who survived and did not survive
```
